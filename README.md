# NYC City Council Tweets

Working through classifying NYC City Council Tweets. Most of the raw data is not here because it is quite large and some of it is sensitive. The notebooks are still a bit sloppy at the moment. 

Scraping is in twscrape.ipynb
Scratch work for analysis, including the VADER and BERT sentiment analysis is in cc_tweet_analysis.ipypnb
A write-up document on the dataset is in tweet_description.ipynb as well as an .html doc of the same name.
Classification is in supervised_classification.ipynb, with sections for the various resampling methods I used with the Naive Bayes classifier as well as fine-tuneing the BERTweet model.
